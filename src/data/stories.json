One sweltering afternoon, while wrestling a toucan for a better camera angle, he heard a wacky rumor from a local mystic: a crocodile in the deepest parts of the Pantanal wetlands was... MAGNETIC! 'A Magneto-Croc!' Flash shouted, nearly dropping his telephoto lens. 'I HAVE to get a picture of it!' His challenge was clear, but finding a creature that defies physics required more than just luck. He needed information, and he knew two very different people who might have it.",
