Space weather is a complex and often invisible phenomenon. While NASA provides a wealth of data on solar flares, CMEs, and cosmic rays, this information can be abstract and difficult for the general public, especially young people, to understand and connect with.

Our solution, Space Weather Stories, bridges this gap by transforming the fundamental scientific concepts derived from NASA's data into engaging, interactive "choose-your-own-adventure" narratives. We don't just present the data; we bring it to life, allowing users to experience the journey of a solar particle or the power of Earth's magnetic field through story.

# ‚ú® Project Description
Space Weather Stories is an interactive educational web application designed to make the science of heliophysics accessible and exciting for everyone. Users step into the roles of cosmic characters‚Äîlike "Cammie the CME" or "Raye the Cosmic Ray"‚Äîand make choices that determine the outcome of their adventure. Each path is designed to teach a core concept of space weather in a memorable and intuitive way.

Our goal is to spark curiosity and inspire a new generation of scientists and explorers by proving that learning about our universe can be a magical and unforgettable adventure.
